## Abstract

The characterization of dengue serotypes to account for phenomena observed in its population dynamics, has been largely done in terms of cross-reactivity that includes cross-protection and cross-enhancement. 
The four dengue serotypes (DENV1-DENV4) are generally classified by their genetic and antigenic properties. 
Studies report that DENV2 and DENV4 are the most genetically distant serotypes. 
Reports on antigenic similarity, on the other hand, indicate that DENV1 and DENV2 are the most distant.  
while sequences of infections most frequently associated to severe dengue are DENV1/DENV2 and DENV1/DENV3. These observations along and the observed heterogeneity in serotype transmission motivate our question as to how to design a mathematical model that incorporates both the history of infections and the cross reactions that affect host susceptibility. 
We explore population dynamics of infections by the four serotypes based on genetic or antigenic similarity and  host susceptibility of individuals with a history of successive infections. We define a mathematical framework to represent host-susceptibility triggered by serotype cross-reactions (cross-protection and cross-enhancement) that account for serotype distance-based (genetic and antigenic) interactions. This approach is achieved by the introduction of what we call a distance-based Reinfection Matrix from which we can also define a serotype hierarchy. We find that both, immune cross-enhancement and immune cross-protection can promote alternating patterns in serotype dynamics. An interplay between serotype Reinfection hierarchy and transmission rates appears to be associated with serotype incidence amount. Simulations suggest that the more similar the serotypes are, the longer the interoutbreak period between them is.
