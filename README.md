# Multiserotype_interactions_model2021

## Abstract
We explore population dynamics of infections by the four serotypes based on genetic or antigenic similarity and  host susceptibility of individuals with a history of successive infections. We define a mathematical framework to represent host-susceptibility triggered by serotype cross-reactions (cross-protection and cross-enhancement) that account for serotype distance-based (genetic and antigenic) interactions. This approach is achieved by the introduction of what we call a distance-based Reinfection Matrix from which we can also define a serotype hierarchy. We find that both, immune cross-enhancement and immune cross-protection can promote alternating patterns in serotype dynamics. An interplay between serotype Reinfection hierarchy and transmission rates appears to be associated with serotype incidence amount. Simulations suggest that the more similar the serotypes are, the longer the interoutbreak period between them is.
