# Multiserotype_interactions_model2020
In recent years, characterization of dengue serotypes has been done in terms of cross-reactivity rather than genetic sequences. These cross reactions occur when previous infections affect the response against subsequent infections in the host.  In this paper, we  study some possible interactions triggered by both dengue serotypes similarity and the susceptibility of individuals who have been previously infected by one or more serotypes.  We assume that cross reactions in the reinfection process changes the host susceptibility. Our main contribution is the description of how to represent distance between serotypes in terms of host susceptibility according to type and order of infections. We find that cross-enhancement as well as cross-protection can promote alternating patterns in serotype dynamics. Simulations with our model suggest that the closest serotypes exhibit longer interval interoutbreaks between them than those observed in the rest of the rest other serotypes.
